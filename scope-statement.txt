The Climate Change Database project aims to develop a website that provides resources and information related to climate change, events, and action items.
The website also offers merchandise items that users can buy to support the site, as well as a donation system to support the organization.
The website will allow users to register to contribute articles or links to events, and only registered users will be able to add comments.
A small staff will validate the links, oversee donations, and ensure that the site is functioning smoothly.
